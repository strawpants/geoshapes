# Convenience ocean masks in the gridded and spherical harmonic domain

## Gridded Ocean mask

`ne_10m_oceangrid_0.125.nc` is computed as described in  [this geoslurp notebook](https://github.com/strawpants/geoslurp/blob/master/docs/source/notebooks/OceanFunction.ipynb).

## Spherical Harmonic expansion of the ocean mask

`ne_10m_oceansh_n300.nc` is computed as described in  [this shxarray notebook](https://github.com/ITC-Water-Resources/shxarray/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/OceanMask.ipynb)
